# UniversityHospital Mastery Project

A program that allows you to add/hire employees to a hospital database and interact with patients.

## Directions

1. Add employees to the database by selecting the hire option.
2. Once employees are added to the database, you can select to pay employees if they havent been paid, view employee info, or tell the medical staff to perform duties.
3. You can view patients to see their statuses. If their statuses are low, you can have the medical staff care for them to increase the patients statuses.
